Adding a new device class (os type)
===================================

Create a file in includes/osdiscovery, which fills the OS type variable if
you can identify the device as such (sysDescr or similar). Please use a
meaningful name!

Adjust discovery.php, running specific command based on OS type, if needed.

Create includes/polling/device-$osname.inc.php, for device specific polling.

Create html/pages/device/graphs/os-$osname.inc.php to display a custom graph
set for this device type.

If desired, create a 32x32 logo, in html/images/os/$osname.png.

When tested and satisfied, please submit a patch to the development team! ;-)
