Introduction
------------

Observer is an auto-discovering network monitoring system. 

It's designed to be an easily-navigable interface to the health of your network.

Installation
------------

Installation of Observer is currently not for the faint of heart! There is no automated
install script, so it'll probably take quite a bit of fiddling!

Please see http://www.project-observer.org.
