Some notes about how to set up your systems, as there are no real other docs:

Customer port parsing
=====================

Set your port description to:

Cust: CustomerName {CircuitDesc} (OptionalNotes) [Speed]

Transit/peering/core port parsing
=================================

Set your port description to:

Transit: whateveryoulike
Peering: whateveryoulike
Core: whateveryoulike

LM-Sensors setup
================

For lm-sensors/net-snmp to put your temperatures in the "Temp" group (as
opposed to the "Misc" group, their name needs to start with "temp"; for
Observer to see the interface the name should start with "temp-" (i.e.
temp-CPU, temp-System). You can change this in /etc/sensors.conf - change
the label descriptions if necessary, under your specific chipset block.

Papouch TME
===========

Set your thermometer name (Option 1->0 in the telnet CLI) to the sensor name
you want displayed in Observer.

Supermicro monitoring
=====================

On Supermicro motherboards, install Superodoctor on your system and put the
extend line into your snmpd.conf as instructed to enable SNMP readouts of
sensor values.
